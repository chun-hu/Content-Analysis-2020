I told him since I again had to leave a VM that I was going to assume that the reason for the noncontrol release generic lamotrigine was due to cost or insurance restraints as there is no documentation in his chart that he needed anything other than what was sent in to Harris Teeter on 12/16/14.  I also told him we do have 24-48 hours to respond to a refill request and as KMC is rounding at the hospital this week  I am covering other doctors, thus the delay in getting back to him today rather than yesterday. My message on his cell phone was a calm and very nice explaination of time frame for prescription refills. I have called in the Lamotrigine 100mg. to Harris Teeter to Jennifer and cancelled the rx. for the Lamictal XR.\par\b Follow-up by: \b0 Denny Cook RN ,  ",REFILL,No,2015_1_4801_1001

Her swallowing issue has gotten worse, she has been in and out of the ER several times. She has had a previous barium swallow study and an upper endoscopy with stretching which have not given a reason why she is having issues swallowing. She is going to be seen by SLP today for another swallow study, and yesterday the speech therapist told them she thought it was a physical problem with the swallowing. Patient has done research online at Mayo Clinic, and saw where issues swallowing and weakness can come from botox, (the website says to report these symptoms days to weeks after injection). Husband wants to know if these issues could be coming from the botox injection, he doesn't have any other idea of where this is coming from. He has already been told the symptoms started to long after the injection, but he wanted input from BJR. Please advise. \par\b ",SYMPTOMS,No,2015_1_5026_1001

I assured her that the fatigue should not be from his daily dose of Keppra. I asked if pt sleeps regular hours and if he has his cell phone in his room. Discussed habits of teenagers of keeping phone in bed on vibrate and texting at late hours of the night. Mom said she would look into this. I also suggested that if fatigue continues without a known trigger to take pt to pcp as mom says he hasn't seen pcp since last year.
